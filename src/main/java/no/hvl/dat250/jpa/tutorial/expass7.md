## Challenges
* I had trouble running the Docker program in the beginning. The way I solved this was by making sure that my Pc had enough storage space, which was the problem why some of the commands did not respond in the beginning.
* I had also trouble compiling the program with the correct Java-version. I solved this by changing terminal to run in WSL, and then make sure that Java and Gradle was installed correctly and set up correctly in build.gradle.kts.

## To do 
* The tests run, so I do not have any more to do in this assignment.
