## Assignment 4

# Explanation
* What was done here was that we filled in different classes and fields of all the classes, such that it made the tests run. The IDE helped me autocomplete the getters and setters, and in order to fill in missing code I used ChatGPT. I made the script "getAllTextFromClasses.py", which lets me give all information to ChatGPT *

# Challenges
* It was hard to understand what to do in the beginning. After doing some research I understood how the relationsal database was displayed in code.*
* I had some trouble importing the Assertion functions in the test file. I got tip from another student how to change it to work with current version of Java.* 

# To do 
* The tests run, so I do not have any more to do in this assignment.*
